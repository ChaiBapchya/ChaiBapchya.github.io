- title: "Added Ruby on Rails to my skills: Oct 2013"
  description: My burning desire to be a full stack developer took a great turn when I started working on RoR for a big project. Originally staffed as a frontend developer, it was difficult to get the right support and work on both frontend and backend. I learnt basic RoR on my own and then got support from my team and a few months later was able to call my self a RoR developer.
