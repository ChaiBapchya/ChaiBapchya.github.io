# LSTM
Source - (Understanding LSTM)[http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/]

### RNN vs NN
- RNN are NN wit loop in them allowing information to persist
- multiple copies of same NN, each passing a message to successor
- RNNs related to "sequences","lists"

### Problem of Long-term Dependencies
#### Short term
 the gap between the relevant information and the place that itâ€™s needed is small, RNN's work
#### Long term
 RNN unable to learn to connect info

### LSTM
- special RNN with Long term capability

# Atlanta Zoo
## Giraffes
1. Sleep
- 2hrs in 1 day
- 10-15mins on avg - power nap

2. Walk
- clumsy
- 1 point in time - both legs - fore and hind of 1 side are in air
- result in destabilized weight distribution

3. sitting
- giraffes sit
- pretty normal for domesticated ones
- those in wild - dont since they are scared of predators

4. ward of enemy forces
e.g. lions
- generally lions wont attack fully grown, sturdy, old giraffes
- since they are well developed, tall and strong/sturdy
- hence they attack the calf
- even if they do, they would do it in herd
- attack mechanism of lion is to grab hold of the animal on the neck and strangle it to death(like antelope)
- to reach the neck of a giraffe means lion would be air-borne and hence doesnt have enough power in it to be able to leap, hold the neck and tear it off with power enough to strangle the giraffe
- so most occasions they resort to attacking the legs (the strongest part of giraffe)
- if giraffe's legs are out of the equation, its easy to kill them

## Pandas
- Pandas in the world are all from China
- Atlanta Zoo houses Pandas from Chengdu
- Pandas there sleep 18 hours a day!
- Most of their life is spent in the Air-conditioned home of theirs. 
- Venturing outside the AC-shelter within the exhibit is itself an adventure and rarity.
