# GRA work (Oracle SQL)
- 30 million + rows
- Complex join statement
- Software used - SquirrelQL (SQL) client + Oracle Client
- To be able to find users (admin, course instructors) who have courses (individual or cross-listed) on Tsquare(GaTech Teaching portal)
#### New - CLOB issue migrating from Oracle SQL to MySQL (Solution - typecast char())
- Broke MySQL Server functionality (can't start using Mac OSX System Preferences "anymore")

# Website
- Integrating Disqus with Jekyll
- Integrating Social Media (Facebook Like,Share, Google+ like, Twitter tweet)

# TA Physics 
- Abnormal behaviour of classroom lights 
- InfraRed driven sensors used in classroom lighting have found hack using student phones to disrupt the class

## Bad UI example
- Subway website - After exchanging 3-4 messages and completing required steps to use the "coupon", it has a countdown to "Redeem the coupon"
1. No pre-intimation that upon clicking "Redeem" countdown begins that will expire after 5 minutes leaving unsuspecting and over-curious website users no choice but to end up with "expired coupon"
Solution - Intimation of an "irrevocable and 1-time" Countdown (which acts as an authentication / verification at the Subway counter)
2. Once countdown begins, website has a Counter + (Get more points button)
I got caught in that subsequent offer and was left with unfinished Countdown, lost Offer Unique ID.
Poor UI design solely to be blamed.
