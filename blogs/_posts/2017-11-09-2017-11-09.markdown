# Can a Computer Improve Your Social Skills?
## GVU Center Brown Bag Seminar: Ehsan Hoque

Explained 3 main projects
A. MACH
interview / public speaking assistance

B. End of life communication
1. Vader (sentiment analysis)
2. clustering analysis - find diff styles of speaking
rated doctor who speaks more and neutral BETTER than who speaks positive n less

ongoig
1. doctor lecturng (patients hate)
2. ask say ask paradigm
3. posturing it in positive way

C. CoCo = Collaboration Coach
using technology to moderate group communication

# UI 
1. showing % - water filled in cubicle
2. giving illusion that computer is thinking and adding a delay instead of giving output right away

U.S.P.
1. Application -> alexa/google home.- collaboration coach
2. Why CoCo? Prevent group-think -> ppl agree with leader (bad for creativity)

Interesting question the project is trying to answer - 
how does giving feedback affect my performance, (performance of giver)?
