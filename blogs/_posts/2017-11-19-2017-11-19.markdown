# LOGIC


With logic, once we correctly describe the world in logical statements,

In order to draw conclusions the logical statements are enough (no need to go back to the world)

Situation Calculus
Adv - full power of first order logic theorem provers (no need for programming)
More flexibility than classical planning or problem solving.

Given initial state, goal state and actions, to be able to find the path

Distinguish b/w probable improbable solutions
AI first gen - 50s to 70s
1. Heavy reliance on Boolean logic (expressing everything in terms of True/False)
Flawed - since uncertainty in world needs Probability (only 1980s)
2. too laborious (painful to write it by hand)

Expert Systems - not considered AI anymore (since too commonplace)
E.S saved US $ 2bn by deciding where to place shipment during Persian Gulf War more than DARPA's investment 


Resolution algo - infer new knowl from kb
graph plan - erric furst - new problems 
value iteration - key process for markov chain 

Agent Design (reflex to goal/utility based)
COmplexity of environment (simple to partially observable, stochastic)
model

## Propositional Logic vs Probability
1. Variables - B, E, Alarm, M calling, Jcalling 
- Prop Logic -> true,false,unknown
- Prob -> 0-1 number

2. Propositional logic sentence is either T/F wrt model of world
J⇔M
model {B:true,E:false,...}

> Valid true - true for all models (all combinations)
> Satisfiable - true for some models not all (any combination of values)

Prop Logic
#### Limitations
1. Doesnt handle uncertainty
2. Cant handle objects (size,weight,color,etc) or relation b/w objects
3. no shortcuts

All 1000 locations are clean 

Conjunction of 1000 propositions

First order logic addresses 2,3

- world(ontological commitment)
- beliefs(epistemilogical commitment)

 | world | belief
--- | --- | ---
FOL | relation,obj,func | T/F/?
Propositional | Facts | T/F/?
Probability | Facts | [0,..,1]

## Types of representation
1. atomic
- (problem solving , search) 
- State A moves to B (no sub / internal structure)

2. factored
- Prop, Probab thoery
- (break world into facts)

3. structured representation 
- values, relationships b/w objects

prop logic
model was P:true, Q:false

FOL
model = set of objects, set of constants A,b,c,d,1,2,3, set of functions

function is mapping of obj to obj

e.g. numberOf maps A->1,B->3,C->3

set of relations

e.g.
1. Above:{[a,b],[c,d]} [binary relation]
2. vowel:{[a]} [unary relation]
3. rainy:{} //empty i.e. not rainy [no object]
4. {[]} //singleton set i.e. rainy

## syntax
- FOL has sentences (like Prop) and terms(unlike Prop)

vowel(A)

above(a,b)

2=2

- operator

> - ¬,∨,∧,,⟺,⟹,()

- term 

A,B,x,y,1,numberOf(A)

- quantifiers

> ∀ = For all 
> ∃ = There exists

#### ∀ accompanied with a conditional whereas ∃ doesnt generally havea conditionally

### Vacuum world
loc,vacuum,dirt,at(v,a)

∃x,y x=y is valid
every model needs to hv object and both terms x,y refer to same objects hence must be true

∃x x=x ⟹ ∀y,∃z y=z 
LHS yes 
rhs if z is y itself y=y

∃x P(x) may not be true for empty set 
hence satisfiable not always valid

in order to show Adjacency of squares or element is member of set,
single implication or simply and operators aren't enough

its important to have a double implication / bidirectional
equivalent/bi-conditional meaning if and only if rather than assertion
