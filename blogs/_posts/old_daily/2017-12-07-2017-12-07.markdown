Difference between "Enjoying what you do" vs "Loving it"
Enjoying - at the end of it, u are tired, u need willpower to do it and willpower reduces with time
loving - u actually feel better after completing it and hence have more energy than before

I'll be so happy until x,y,z..
u have to be happy during process (enjoy process)

become an expert at whatever you do

2 types of intelligence
