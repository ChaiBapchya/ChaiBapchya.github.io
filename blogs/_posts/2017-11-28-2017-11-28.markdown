What if Block chain technology was applied to Mobile phone contacts?

Today as we sat home preparing for the finals week, I hear my room-mate Ajinkya get disturbed by an unkown call. From someone who wanted to talk to Maddy!

My first reaction - taunting him - "Someone is going to get lucky!"

Later it struck me, it's a problem which can and should be resolved.
Block-chain technology has now set its foot on global technology space. It's effects can be seen world-wide. Shooting Bitcoin prices are just one example of those!

More importantly this concept of "Distributed ledger" has seen some interesting applications - from financial transations, education technology to even medical report documentation.

So why not apply this to our Mobile phone contacts?

Before you counter me by saying - Have you forgotten one the fundamental and one of the most talked about rights of 21st century a.k.a Right to Privacy?? - hear me out!

I'm not asking Maddy to give me her contact number! I'm not interested and nor is she!
But how about Maddy's long lost friends (someone who called Jinx) knowing that the number has been changed?

and that way the number should be erased from their phones warning them that the person has changed their number
so erasing the old number
