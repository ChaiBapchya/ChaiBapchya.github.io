I'm a computer science graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology. Over the first 2 semesters at GaTech (Fall 17, Spring 18) I was a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at Center for 21st Century Universities involved in research around Education Technology. 

I was fortunate enough to be a Teaching Assistant along with a GRA in the first semester of my schooling in USA. Being a TA for Physics course was super challenging. I was responsible for conducting recitations for 3 batches over the semester and taught around 70+ students overall. Revising foundational concepts of electro-magnetism, electric circuits and solving problems on Kirchoff's and Gauss law took me back to my undergrad whilst exposing me to US teaching system. All in all, it was an insightful experience.



As part of my 4-year undergrad (Bachelors in Computer Engineering at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, I was actively involved in research work and applied Machine Learning. Dabbling my hands in the field of Image Recognition and Machine Learning, I researched on Skin Image Recognition using RGB, HSV and YCbCr color models. We successfully detected and differentiated skin pixels from non-skin using a weighted combination of different color models. Our work revolved around training and building the mathematical formula to help improve the accuracy (>90%). Further, I have assisted Nexchanges in building an end-to-end Data Analytics pipeline. Right from Data Extraction using Python libraries Scrapy and Beautiful Soup to Data Warehousing to the final Data Visualization using D3.js, I have learnt immensely thanks to Nexchanges. 

Being a firm believer in open science framework and the principle of reproducible work, I actively publish my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChaiBapchya). Over the past year, I have managed to become a Contributer to the open source Deep Learning framework, [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org). Being an incubator project under Apache organisation, it allows me to be a part of a vibrant and intelligent open source community. I aspire to be elected as a Committer (next logical step) of the Github repository : [apache/incubator-mxnet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/)

After the rise of E-commerce, social media and messenger bots, rapid developments have been made in the field of connecting things, gadgets, and devices, i.e, the Internet of Things (IoT). In the fast-paced lifestyle, it is very difficult to maintain multiple keys for tra- ditional mechanical locks. Electromagnetic smart locks are a possible solution to this problem. To connect a smart lock with a key, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol can be used. BLE protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Ensuring security over BLE is an ongoing challenge. This paper aims to analyze the MITM vulnerability of BLE and develop a possible solution for designing smart-locks with an increased level of security. The observation shows that the combina- tion of Image Steganography and Cryptography helps to overcome the vulnerabilities of BLE protocol.

    <strong>Human Skin Detection Using RGB, HSV and YCbCr Color Models</strong><br>

Human Skin detection deals with the recognition of skin-colored pixels and regions in a given image. Skin color is often used in human skin detection because it is invariant to orientation and size and is fast to pro- cess. A new human skin detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The three main parameters for recogniz- ing a skin pixel are RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and YCbCr (Luminance, Chromi- nance) color models. The objective of proposed algorithm is to improve the recognition of skin pixels in given images. The algorithm not only considers individual ranges of the three color parameters but also takes into ac- count combinational ranges which provide greater accuracy in recognizing the skin area in a given image.
