I'm a Software Developer Engineer at Amazon Web Services(AWS). Within the AWS organization, I work in the Deep Engines team as a part of Amazon AI. Specifically, I work on [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/), an open-source deep learning framework (competing against the likes of Google's Tensorflow and Facebook's PyTorch).

Before joining AWS, I was a CS graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology. Over the period of 3 semesters at GaTech (Fall 17, Spring 18, Spring 19) I was a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) at Center for 21st Century Universities involved in research around Education Technology. In my final semester (3rd), I got to work on a Blockchain POC (Proof of Concept) project (Blockchain for Academic Credentials) with C21U. I got to contribute to the Blockcerts repository (MIT's blockchain for academic project).

<h2>Intern in US</h2>

Thanks to Georgia Tech's [Co-Op program](https://career.gatech.edu/co-op), I spent my Fall 2018 semester in Palo Alto, California working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as an SDE Intern. I was lucky to be assigned Amazon AI org and specifically in the Deep Engine team. Over the 4 months (Fall 2018), I could get my hands dirty with mathematics, C++ and Machine Learning (you may call it Deep Learning to sound cool). To be precise, instead of just "using the framework" (`import mxnet as mx`), I could look at the framework from architecture standpoint; learning it's front-end and back-end. The name of the framework is [Apache MXNet](http://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/), an incubator project licensed under Apache. It is an open-source Deep Learning framework (akin to [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/)) which boasts high performance and great results along with user-friendly APIs with a multi-language support (to name a few - Python, R, Clojure, even Java APIs). All in all, it was an incredible learning experience to work in the Big 4 Tech company and yet be involved in an open-source project (200+ [Github](https://github.com/ChaiBapchya/) contributions over the year! Yay!)

Over the summer of 2018, I was lucky to be a part of [Verizon Connect](https://www.verizonconnect.com/) (previously Verizon Telematics). I got to work on 2 Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) related to automobile/fleet management. First one being "Device to Blockchain" - an effort to prevent odometer fraud and other tampering of vehicular data by removing intermediaries in data measurement and record-keeping. I got to work on Ethereum and Solidity smart contracts, as a part of this project and we were able to demonstrate a product that could potentially help insurance companies, customers, manufacturers and automobile maintenance service agents. Second project was "Predictive Maintenance" (differentiate from Preventive and Corrective). We build a variant of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model based on the time-series data about Diagnostic Test Codes (DTC). The model ingested million+ data points to come up with a prediction of whether the car would suffer from any of the top 10 DTCs in the next 30 days - pretty cool feature! Classic multi-class classification problem.

<h2>Back to the academics (Grad school)</h2>

Complimenting my research work in Edutech, I dived into the realm of Health Care tech and User Experience in the first semester (Fall 2017). Thanks to Lauren Wilcox, I was able to work on a product called Rapport - an interactive website for presenting radiology reports to layman. It involved Natural Language Processing, Model Visualization and Website Development. At the end of the semester, I was able to successfully stitch together BioDigital (human model) with the Radiology reports on the demo website. [Rapport CS 8903 - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9gTR6IzEqM&t=272s)

Moreover, I was fortunate enough to be a Teaching Assistant along with a GRA in the first semester of my schooling in USA. Being a TA for Physics course was super challenging. I was responsible for conducting recitations for 3 batches over the semester and taught around 70+ students overall. Revising foundational concepts of electro-magnetism, electric circuits and solving problems on Kirchoff's and Gauss law took me back to my undergrad whilst exposing me to US teaching system. All in all, it was an insightful experience.

<h2>First Foray into the computer science world (Under-grad)</h2>

As a part of my 4-year undergrad (Bachelors in Computer Engineering at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, I was actively involved in research work and applied Machine Learning. Dabbling my hands in the field of Image Recognition and Machine Learning, I researched on Skin Image Recognition using RGB, HSV and YCbCr color models. We successfully detected and differentiated skin pixels from non-skin using a weighted combination of different color models. Our work revolved around training and building the mathematical formula to help improve the accuracy (>90%). Further, I have assisted Nexchanges in building an end-to-end Data Analytics pipeline. Right from Data Extraction using Python libraries Scrapy and Beautiful Soup to Data Warehousing to the final Data Visualization using D3.js, I have learnt immensely thanks to Nexchanges. 

<h2>O hail Open Source!</h2>

Being a firm believer in open science framework and the principle of reproducible work, I actively publish my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChaiBapchya). Over the past year, I have managed to become a Contributer to the open source Deep Learning framework, [Apache MXNet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org). Being an incubator project under Apache organisation, it allows me to be a part of a vibrant and intelligent open source community. I aspire to be elected as a Committer (next logical step) of the Github repository : [apache/incubator-mxnet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/)

    <strong>Smart-Lock Security Re-engineered using Cryptography and Steganography</strong><br>

After the rise of E-commerce, social media and messenger bots, rapid developments have been made in the field of connecting things, gadgets, and devices, i.e, the Internet of Things (IoT). In the fast-paced lifestyle, it is very difficult to maintain multiple keys for tra- ditional mechanical locks. Electromagnetic smart locks are a possible solution to this problem. To connect a smart lock with a key, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol can be used. BLE protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Ensuring security over BLE is an ongoing challenge. This paper aims to analyze the MITM vulnerability of BLE and develop a possible solution for designing smart-locks with an increased level of security. The observation shows that the combina- tion of Image Steganography and Cryptography helps to overcome the vulnerabilities of BLE protocol.

    <strong>Human Skin Detection Using RGB, HSV and YCbCr Color Models</strong><br>

Human Skin detection deals with the recognition of skin-colored pixels and regions in a given image. Skin color is often used in human skin detection because it is invariant to orientation and size and is fast to pro- cess. A new human skin detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The three main parameters for recogniz- ing a skin pixel are RGB (Red, Green, Blue), HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) and YCbCr (Luminance, Chromi- nance) color models. The objective of proposed algorithm is to improve the recognition of skin pixels in given images. The algorithm not only considers individual ranges of the three color parameters but also takes into ac- count combinational ranges which provide greater accuracy in recognizing the skin area in a given image.
