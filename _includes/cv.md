Being a firm believer in open science framework and the principle of reproducible work, I actively publish my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ChaiBapchya).

As part of my 4-year undergrad (Bachelors in Computer Engineering at Sardar Patel Institute of Technology, I was actively involved in research work and applied Machine Learning. Dabbling my hands in the field of Image Recognition and Machine Learning, I researched on Skin Image Recognition using RGB, HSV and YCbCr color models. We successfully detected and differentiated skin pixels from non-skin using a weighted combination of different color models. Our work revolved around training and building the mathematical formula to help improve the accuracy (>90%). Further, I have assisted NexchangesAs examples, see our [input-convex neural network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07152) and [OptNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00443) papers.

    <strong>Smart-Lock Security Re-engineered using Cryptography and Steganography</strong><br>

After the rise of E-commerce, social media and messenger bots, rapid developments have been made in the field of connecting things, gadgets, and devices, i.e, the Internet of Things (IoT). In the fast-paced lifestyle, it is very difficult to maintain multiple keys for tra- ditional mechanical locks. Electromagnetic smart locks are a possible solution to this problem. To connect a smart lock with a key, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol can be used. BLE protocol is vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. Ensuring security over BLE is an ongoing challenge. This paper aims to analyze the MITM vulnerability of BLE and develop a possible solution for designing smart-locks with an increased level of security. The observation shows that the combina- tion of Image Steganography and Cryptography helps to overcome the vulnerabilities of BLE protocol.

    <strong>OptNet: Differentiable Optimization as a Layer in Neural Networks</strong><br>

    ICML 2017<br>

This paper presents OptNet, a network architecture that integrates
optimization problems (here, specifically in the form of quadratic programs)
as individual layers in larger end-to-end trainable deep networks.
These layers encode constraints and complex dependencies
between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and
fully-connected layers often cannot capture.
In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture:
we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel
optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to
exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect
to layer parameters;
we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast
GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which
provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of
the solve;
and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems.
In one notable example, we show that the method is
capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game;
this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard
constraints better than other neural architectures.
